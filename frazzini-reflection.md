# Reflection

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The branching and merging concepts were still confusing to me  little bit and how they smoothly worked in conjunction with Git and GitHub. I didn't know what README meant and creating a repo in github until today, understanding what they all do and how to do them helps some things become more clear. 

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Seeing the results of a Merge Conflict was new to me, as well as clarifying and utilizing fetch and pull both in Git and more pull requests in GitHub. I used to make commits on every individual update to a file, but hadn't really realized or practice commiting full branches and directories to save time. I learned more about how to utilize git push and not always needing "origin" in the command. "

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Did not have a pair, just a guide. Had some questions about his dbc background and he gave me some good tips about potentially repeating one of the phases after phase 0 as the 2nd 9 weeks is essentially covering 15 weeks of material, and how Chicago DBC is one of the more intense programs. I asked about fetch and pull clarity. 

* What still confuses you about Git?

 There are so many letters that you can utilize in Git, that I still don't understand all of them and what use they have or where they may benifit my workflows. My Guide was talking about git push and three diff. ways to utilize it, and I can't remember what they all were. One was with using origin, one was with using the branch name on the end of the command, and there was a third, can't remember what it was though.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
First experience was good. Another pair didn't sign up with me, so it was just my guide, Kit Robinson and myself. I saw this as both a pro and con. Felt I got more personal one on one help and feedback, and able to go at my own pace if that was necessary ever. It would have been nice to have a pair with me to feed any questions off one another that I might not think of. I know there is more things that will confuse me and I'll have more questions, but sometimes thinking of them at the moment can be a challenge. Having a guide during some pairings seem awesome and will be a big help, Kit did a great job at giving pointers and advice in areas outside the tasks in the canvas that I may have not come across for a while myself.
